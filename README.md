# 🏥 Reducing Hospital Readmission Risks Using Data - Driven Insights

This repository contains datasets for a hospital readmission analysis project. The project involves initial data cleaning using Excel, followed by advanced cleaning and analysis in PostgreSQL, and concludes with visualization of insights using Power BI. Some synthetic data quality challenges were added to the initial raw dataset to mimic real-world data issues commonly found in messy healthcare records.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The following datasets are organized under the `data/` directory of this repository:

### 1. `data/raw/`
- `hospital_readmissions_raw.csv`: Original unprocessed dataset.

### 2. `data/data_challenges_introduced/`
- `hospital_readmissions_data_challenges.csv`: A version of the dataset with data quality issues intentionally introduced.
- `synthetic_data_quality_challenges.csv`: A list of synthetic data challenges that were introduced into the raw dataset to simulate realistic data issues and inconsistencies.

### 3. `data/cleaned/excel/`
- `hospital_readmissions_cleaned.csv`: Dataset cleaned using Excel.
